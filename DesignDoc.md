# Main inspiration

This idea came to me in form of animations from some of games I enjoyed.

1) Super Smash Bros (2d fighting) Cloud/CapFalcon down smash. If performed right opponent will be hit once then will be "grabbed" behind and hit once again.

2) Diablo2/PathOfExile movement which happens on a flat surface yet camera is set in certain perspective to allow comfortable movement and actions in 8 directions.

3) RocketLeague as a feel for game where you interact with whole level and other players to achieve your goal or just marvel on bizzare clashes and crashes.

Of course I could mention something like Ninja Turtles fighing or Kunio Kun or Double Dragon or Streets of Rage. But these game actually so invested in multi-lane uni-dimensional actions/movement that it hurts variety in things you could do.

# Random thoughts

Just actual "fun" brawler in isometric perspective. Where you could kick things, grab opponents, do crazy things like "death dance" from D2 or some combo style hit-sequences.

Dodge and block as useful actions to defend yourself. Projectiles, explosives, traps, pits.

Actually things that I don't want to see are some corridors or narrow labyrinths. Yet this is ok as long as it is fun.

# First thing to try

Do some perspective rendering and image movement.

Do some keyboard keys work to allow smooth yet limited movement with end lag for moves.
